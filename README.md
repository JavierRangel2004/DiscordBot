## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the DiscordBot, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (if not using Docker)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (optional, for Docker deployment)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JavierRangel2004/DiscordBot.git
cd DiscordBot
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

```env
TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
GUILD_ID=your_test_guild_id
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

- `TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token.
- `CLIENT_ID`: Your Discord application's client ID.
- `GUILD_ID`: The ID of your Discord server where you want to deploy commands.
- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.

### Config File

Edit the `config.json` file to include developer IDs and test server ID:

```json
{
  "devs": ["your_developer_id"],
  "testServer": "your_test_server_id"
}
```

- `devs`: An array of Discord user IDs who are considered developers.
- `testServer`: The ID of the Discord server used for testing commands.

## Usage

### Running the Bot

To start the bot in development mode with auto-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To start the bot normally:

```bash
npm start
```

### Deploying Commands

Before using the bot's commands, you need to deploy them to your Discord server.

```bash
npm run deploy-commands
```

This script reads all command files and registers them with your specified guild.

### Using Docker

Docker simplifies the deployment process. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

1. **Build and Start the Containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Accessing the Bot:**

   The bot will be running inside a Docker container and connected to a MongoDB instance also running in a container.

3. **Stopping the Containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

**Note:** Ensure your `.env` file is properly configured as Docker Compose uses it to set environment variables.
